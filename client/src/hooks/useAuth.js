// client/src/hooks/useAuth.js
import { useContext } from 'react';
// NOTE: The AuthContext definition itself should be in AuthContext.jsx
// This file is just a convenience hook, but often people put the hook
// in the same file as the context. Let's assume AuthContext is imported
// if it were separate. For simplicity, we use the hook defined IN AuthContext.jsx
// export { useAuth } from '../contexts/AuthContext'; // If defined in context file
